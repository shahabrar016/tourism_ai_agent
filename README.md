    "attractions": "In 2025, top attractions include Srinagar's Dal Lake (houseboat stays and shikara rides), Pahalgam's Betaab Valley (trekking and picnics), Gulmarg's ski resorts (now with eco-friendly gondolas), Sonmarg's Thajiwas Glacier (adventure hikes), new eco-spots like Gurez Valley (offbeat camping), and cultural sites like Jamia Masjid. For families, try Tulip Garden in April blooms.",
    "best time": "Best time in 2025: April-October for mild weather (10-30°C). Peak tulip season: March-April. Summer (May-July) for festivals like Kashmir Music Fest. Autumn (September-October) for golden chinar leaves. Winter (December-February) for snow sports, but expect road closures—check advisories. Avoid monsoon if prone to landslides.",
    "safety": "As of 2025, Kashmir is safer for tourists with improved infrastructure and security in key areas like Srinagar, Gulmarg, and Pahalgam. Government reports low incidents; locals are hospitable. Stick to tourist zones, use verified apps for bookings, and monitor MEA advisories. Safe for solo women and families with precautions like group travel.",
    "tips": "Tips: Book via apps like MakeMyTrip for deals. Carry ID always. Try local Wazwan cuisine but check spice levels. Use UPI for payments. For eco-tourism, opt for sustainable homestays. Acclimatize to altitudes to avoid sickness. Rent electric vehicles in Srinagar for green travel.",
    "accommodations": "Options: Luxury houseboats on Dal Lake (~₹5000/night), budget guesthouses in Pahalgam (~₹2000), eco-resorts in Gurez (~₹3000). In 2025, new glamping sites in Sonmarg. Book early for peaks.",
    "cuisine": "Must-try: Rogan Josh, Dum Aloo, Kahwa tea. Street food like Tsot in Srinagar markets. Vegan options increasing with tourism boom.",
    "default": "Sorry, I didn't catch that. Ask about attractions, best time, safety, tips, accommodations, cuisine, or request a personalized itinerary!"
